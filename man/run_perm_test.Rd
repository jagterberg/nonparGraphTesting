\title{Runs the permutation test given the value of the U-statistic
the number of repetitions, and the estimated latent positions
Code written in Fall of 2018, so may be buggy}
\usage{
run_perm_test(U, nsims, X, Y, dist.mat = NULL, p.val = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{value of null U statistic}

\item{nsims}{number of simulations}

\item{X}{estimates for latent positions 1}

\item{Y}{estimates for latent positions 2}

\item{dist.mat}{Optional, a distance matrix precalculated already so as not to recalculate.
If null, the function is recursively run to calculate it
Note: currently the function has a bug if dist.mat is null}

\item{p.val}{if TRUE, return estimated p.value.  Otherwise, return vector of permuted test
statistics}
}
\value{
either an estimated p-value under the null or the vector of permuted test statistics
}
